Thanks to an issue raised on Uncharted by a fellow GitHub user pointing out that a lack of good examples was stopping people see if my work was any good and worth using I've started going through all my projects 
and making sure they all have proper example pages and decent instructions in their README files.

So far the following have been updated:

Obscura - [Examples](http://oinutter.github.com/Obscura/) | [Documentation](http://github.com/OiNutter/Obscura#readme)  
Uncharted - [Examples](http://oinutter.github.com/uncharted/) | [Documentation](http://github.com/OiNutter/uncharted#readme)  
Ermintrude - [Examples](http://oinutter.github.com/ermintrude/) | [Documentation](http://github.com/OiNutter/ermintrude#readme)
