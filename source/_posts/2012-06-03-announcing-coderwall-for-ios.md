After 2 months of wrestling with the App Store review process, I am proud to announce the release of my first iOS app, [Coderwall](http://oinutter.github.com/Coderwall-iOS). The app accesses [Coderwall.com](http://coderwall.com)'s API and pulls down all your profile information and your list of achievements etc, and displays it in a native format, giving you access to your, and your friends', information on the go.

At the moment the app is a very basic read only affair as Coderwall's API is read only, but I know they have plans to expand on the API, particularly to enable access to some of the new features they are adding to the main site, and as they do I'll be updating the app to take advantage of those.

The app is free to download for both iPhone and iPad, and also the source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/OiNutter/Coderwall-iOS) for anyone wanting to take a look and use it to help them get started in app development. The app was very much a learning exercise for me, which is why I've made it free to download and open sourced it, in the hope that the lessons I've learned will benefit someone else.

Also if you have any issues, or feature requests, you can use GitHub to tell me about them, or even submit a pull request for them.

There will be a Windows Phone version released, hopefully, in the next few months, will post more about that when it is released, and once I've got that out of the way I'm going to be looking at adding more functionality to both apps, so watch this space!

I'd like to say a big thanks to the guys at Coderwall, particularly Matt, who have been really helpful and supportive of me while I've been building this app, particularly in making extra information available to me via the API and in offering to add more functionality so we can make the app even better. Thanks very much guys, hope you like it!
