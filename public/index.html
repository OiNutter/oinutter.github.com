  <div class="entry-content"><p>So assuming anybody out there actually reads this blog more than once, you may have noticed a few things lately. Firstly that I&#8217;ve not posted in far too long,
and secondly that there have been some changes around here. Well, it&#8217;s not just the blog, hence the extended break from posts. As the title of this post suggests
2012 is a year of new beginnings for me. I&#8217;ve started a new job, more on that later, and decided to move my blog away from wordpress and give it a bit of an
overhaul.</p>

<p>Firstly, why the move? Well for one thing having done some work on setting up custom Wordpress sites for people recently I have massively fallen out of love with
it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, for the layperson who wants a basic blog it&#8217;s great. But for me it just wasn&#8217;t working out. There was also the fact that it was costing me
for hosting and I wanted some cheap decent hosting. Enter <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, I&#8217;d seen some information on this a couple of times but never really
properly looked at it, until now. For those that haven&#8217;t heard of it, Octopress is a blogging framework designed with hackers/coders in mind. It&#8217;s built on top of
<a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> the blog-aware static site generator that is used by GitHub pages. The way it works is that you create your posts in
Markdown or HTML files, then run a Rake task which then builds static pages with your content on them. What this means is no database requirements, and technically
no server side language required. This meant I had the choice of 2 (that I knew of) possible hosting options, <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> or
<a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>. Both seemed like good options, both were free, had good levels of support and service, and would let me use custom domains. In the end
I decided to go with Heroku as I&#8217;d been wanting to try them out for a while and it gives me a good scalability, so while it&#8217;s free for now, I can add more to it if
I need to. So far this seems to be working out pretty well for me and I&#8217;ve since started hosting another project that I&#8217;m working on with them. As for Octopress,
I&#8217;m really happy with that and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone needing a simple blogging solution.</p>

<p>As for the new job, well I&#8217;m now working at a games company called Eutechnyx in Gateshead. I&#8217;m one of the main Web Developers working on their new Online Racing MMO
Auto Club Revolution. This has been a big change for me as it&#8217;s meant leaving behind PHP and MySQL and embracing Python and MongoDB. I&#8217;ve also had to get to grips with
SVN which has been a considerably less enjoyable process. As for Python and Mongo I&#8217;m really enjoying them. Python is still a strange language to adapt to with it&#8217;s
whitespace orientated style, thankfully the time I&#8217;ve spent using CoffeeScript lately has probably helped a great deal with that. I&#8217;ve also been using Mongo on a private
project I&#8217;m working on with Ruby and Sinatra and finding that really snappy easy to work with once you understand the way embedding documents works.</p>

<p>So what does the future hold for me? Well I think that for now I&#8217;m leaving PHP and MySQL behind. I&#8217;m still going to be continuing in my Javascript development and
looking to bring CoffeeScript into that as much as possible but my server side work is now going to be either Python or Ruby, both of which I&#8217;m having a lot of fun
with at the moment. As for my choice of data storage? I think it&#8217;s safe to say MongoDB is here to stay on that front, although I will miss working out clever SQL
queries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So this month I&#8217;ve been playing with something new&#8230; again (I&#8217;m going through an experimental phase I guess). This month it was Ruby, or more specifically Ruby Gems. I&#8217;ve used Ruby a little in the Rakefiles I
use for building my javascript projects but not really done any major work with it, until now.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to find a nice simple solution for setting up my project skeletons quickly and easily. I&#8217;d thought of some sort of Git repository but then I&#8217;d end up with some faffy process involving multiple
branches for different project types and having to clone a repository and then remove the git repository in the newly cloned folder and well, this didn&#8217;t sound quick or easy. Eventually I hit on the idea of a
command line ruby gem that could use templates defining a directory structure to set up what I needed. A quick search turned up nothing that seemed to do the job, the closest thing was
<a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/bones">Mr Bones</a> but that seemed to be entirely for Ruby projects and the template skeleton wasn&#8217;t easily customisable.  I was disappointed that it existed though as I wanted to name
my gem bones but hey, how many things am I going to write that I can actually justify calling Skeletor?</p>

<p>So I started looking into what was involved in creating ruby gems. Initially I started of using <a href="https://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler">Jeweler</a> but this created a lot of stuff I didn&#8217;t really understand
so I decided to strip everything back and just look at the structure of some gems I already used. My main source of reference was Sprockets but I also used Capistrano when trying to understand the command line
aspect of the gem. These gave me a good source of reference for what was required in the various gem files.</p>

<p>For anyone who&#8217;s not created gemfiles before the basic folder structure is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>lib - contains 1 ruby file with the same name as the gem and a folder also named after the gem which contains all the code for the gem</li>
<li>bin - optional folder that contains the command line executable files for the gem</li>
<li>test - contains the unit test files</li>
<li>a Gemfile that contains the dependencies for the gem</li>
<li>a.gemspec file that contains the configuration details for building the gem</li>
<li>the usual README and LICENSE files in your choice of format</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;m not going to go into the details of each of those files.  I&#8217;d say the best thing to do is to check out the source of some of the gems that you use and that will probably give you the best understanding of
what&#8217;s required. I&#8217;m using <a href="https://github.com/wycats/thor">Thor</a> for the command line interface and <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/hike">Hike</a> to locate the files in the 2 possible load paths.</p>

<p>Skeletor supports defining a directory structure with files and folders. You can also specify include files which will be copied into the directory, either from a local file or a remote url, and define build
tasks to be run after the directory is set up.</p>

<p>The code for Skeletor is actually pretty simple. Ruby&#8217;s built in YAML.load function converts the template file into a Ruby Hash object which can then be looped through and there is a
<a href="http://flori.github.com/json/">JSON gem</a> that works in the same way. The most complicated part was the validation code as I needed to be able to specify custom data types that a node could match any one of. 
The only gem I could find for YAML validation was <a href="http://www.kuwata-lab.com/kwalify/">Kwalify</a> but that wasn&#8217;t flexible enough for what I needed so I had to write my own. I eventually managed to get a working
validation class that worked for what I wanted and decided to extract it into it&#8217;s own gem so it could be used for other projects, and thus Grayskull was born.</p>

<p>Grayskull will validate JSON and YAML files against a given schema including matching against custom types. All the details for how to create the schema are at the GitHub page, as are the instructions on how to
install and use it. The same goes for Skeletor. Grayskull is also using Thor for the command line as well as the aforementioned JSON gem for validation.</p>

<p>Check out the GitHub repositories for the source code and instructions.</p>

<time datetime="2011-08-26T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 26<span>th</span>, 2011</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently managed to get myself a Macbook, which besides finally giving me a home computer that can cope with what I&#8217;m throwing at it, has finally enabled me to start looking at iOS development. I&#8217;ve briefly
played with Android development but what little Java skills I picked up at university and was able to remember after all this time weren&#8217;t quite up to the task. So you&#8217;d think that tackling developing in
Objective-C, a language I&#8217;ve never used, would be an even bigger challenge right? Well thankfully I managed to find some help, primarily from iTunes U. If anyone hasn&#8217;t checked this out yet I&#8217;d highly recommend
it, there are a load of free to download lectures from several of the big universities on there (primarily US from what I could see but there were some others). The course I&#8217;ve been following is Stanford&#8217;s
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/cs193p-student-final-projects/id395605774?i=90218598" title="iTunes U Download for C193p">cs193p</a> course on iOS application development by Paul Hegarty. If you can get past Paul&#8217;s
slightly eccentric seeming nature, anyone wanting to get into iOS development would do well to check this out. I&#8217;m only a few lectures in at the moment but the course has already succeeded in helping me finally
get my head around MVC.</p>

<p>So what do I think of Objective-C? Well I&#8217;m still in my early stages of playing with the language so this is really just a first impression but I think I&#8217;m going to like developing in it, and I certainly think
I&#8217;m going to find it easier and more enjoyable than I ever did Java. It&#8217;s very different from most of the languages I&#8217;ve ever learned and certainly a huge change from the languages I use on a daily basis (PHP
and Javascript). One of the first things I&#8217;ve noticed is how verbose it is. There is very much a convention of the code reading like plain english, with things such as long variable names and methods. The way
methods are defined is one of the primary examples I would give of this verbosity, and of the difference of Objective-C to languages I&#8217;m used to. The following examples show a comparison of how methods are
defined in Actionscript 3 (I know, I know, but it&#8217;s the only langauge I know well enough to write comparison code in that defines the return and argument types) and Objective-C.</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1171831.js?file=as3style.as'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>//Actionscript 3 - Method Definitions

//single argument methods
public function doubleNumber(double: number):double;

//multiple argument methods
public function multiplyNumberByAnotherNumber(double: number1,double: number2):double;</code></pre></noscript></div>




<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1171831.js?file=objcstyle.m'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>//Objective-C Method Definitions

//single argument method
- (double) doubleNumber:(double)number;

//mulitple argument method
- (double) multiplyNumber:(double)number1 byAnotherNumber:(double)number2;

</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>As you can see the single argument methods are pretty straight forward, return type at the start, followed by the method name, then the argument and it&#8217;s type listed after a semi colon (felt weird having no
brackets). From what I&#8217;ve seen there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any indication of public or private with the method definitions. What seems to happen is that you just don&#8217;t define methods you want to be private in your
header file, which defines the class&#8217; public api. The - at the start of the definition indicates that this is an instance method, a + indicates a static method. The primary difference in the way methods are
defined is when it comes to methods with multiple arguments, where you see this splitting of the method name. The only real purpose I can see of this is that if you write your method names and variables properly
it helps the code read like plain english.</p>

<p>As for developing in XCode, so far I&#8217;m liking it. The built-in Interface Builder Gui tools are really helpful, especially when it comes to linking the controller to your views.  It&#8217;s taking me a little while to
find everything in the property inspectors, possibly because what I&#8217;m looking for isn&#8217;t available for customisation but you never know. The in-line error and warning highlighting is really helpful as it makes it
much easier to see where you&#8217;ve missed that semi-colon or curly brace. I think I&#8217;m really going to like the property synthesization (more on that once I&#8217;ve gone more in-depth with it) that allows the compiler to
auto generate methods for you.</p>

<p>Developing for iOS is going to present me with some new challenges that I wouldn&#8217;t normally have to contend with such as Memory Management, which is going to take some getting used to, but that&#8217;s half the fun.
So hopefully before too long I&#8217;ll be posting about my new app that you can all go and buy and make me millions, (although based on how many readers I probably have  I might be lucky to make a pound!).  I promise
it won&#8217;t be a new fart app!</p>

<time datetime="2011-06-10T00:00:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 10<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a busy few months so I&#8217;m a bit behind on my posting so hopefully I can get back on schedule now. Once again I&#8217;ve been working on another javascript
library, this time a canvas based image manipulation library called Obscura.</p>

<p>t all started with the arrival on the scene of <a href="http://microjs.com">microjs.com</a> by <a href="http://mir.aculo.us">Thomas Fuchs</a> and <a href="http://dustindiaz.com/">Dustin Diaz</a>.
For those of you who haven&#8217;t heard of it, <a href="http://microjs.com">microjs.com</a> is an index of micro frameworks curated by Thomas and Dustin. The requirements for
inclusion on the site are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Must be written in javascript</li>
<li>Must be less than 5k minified and gzipped</li>
<li>Must be focused on one thing, rather than being a library of all trades</li>
<li>Must have no dependencies</li>
</ul>


<p>I liked the idea of this and was keen to get a listing on there as a step towards my goal of becoming more known in the community. Unfortunately none of my
previous projects met the requirements, so if I wanted in I needed to come up with something else. I&#8217;d seen a tutorial in .Net magazine on image editing using
javascript and canvas and decided I could port my existing PHP ImageHandler class to javascript using canvas as a base.</p>

<p>I also decided to use this as an oppurtunity to try out <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> which I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot about. Once
again, for those out of the loop, CoffeeScript is a lot like <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>, which I&#8217;ve mentioned previously, but for Javascript. It&#8217;s a language
that compiles to javascript, so you can write your code in CoffeeScript&#8217;s clearer, more verbose syntax, then compile it to normal working syntax.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not normally a fan of stuff like this as I&#8217;ve never really seen the point, if you want to write javascript just learn javascript. However both Sass and
CoffeeScript have convinced me that there are benefits to these things. In the case of CoffeeScript the automatic handling of things like scope and variable
declaration make developing a lot easier and safer. The automatic wrapping in a function did cause me some confusion at first, which I&#8217;ll discuss later, but does
prevent any unnecessary pollution of the global scope and can be turned off with a compile option. I am however still adjusting to the braceless syntax which I&#8217;m
not too keen on. I appreciate that it makes the code cleaner and smaller but as a php developer predominantly I&#8217;ve grown used to curly braces or at the very least
some kind of ruby-esque closing statement.</p>

<p>I decided to stick with a small selection of basic image manipulation functions to start with. As I was using my existing PHP library as a starting point I had a
ready supplied list of functions to use, with the basic logic all worked out. All I needed to do was work out how to write the functions in CoffeeScript and
understand how to apply them with canvas. The latter proved to be the more challenging task for the most part. Particularly due to the inconsistencies in how the
W3C&#8217;s canvas spec is implemented in Gecko and Webkit. The main issue I came across was when working on the rotate function. I had been using the
globalCompositeMethod copy to overwrite the existing canvas data which worked fine in Firefox but in Safari and Chrome &#8220;copy&#8221; actually overlays the new data onto
the old, so the original, unrotated image was still visible. I ended up having to create an internal canvas object as a kind of staging area so all manipulations
were performed on that before the finished article was sent to the target canvas.</p>

<p>By far my favourite CoffeeScript feature when writing this was the way it handles scope and the ability to reference the parent object easily when writing the
code made life considerably easier, particularly as all the functions perform operations on internal objects. For any of you who haven&#8217;t played with CoffeeScript
yet or aren&#8217;t familiar with the scope handling, it works like this:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1084753.js?file=example.coffee'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>object -&gt;
    @prop = 'foo'
    @bar = (newProp) =&gt;
        @prop = newProp</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Which will compile to this</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1084753.js?file=compiled.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>(function() {
  var __bind = function(fn, me){ return function(){ return fn.apply(me, arguments); }; };
  object(function() {
    this.prop = 'foo';
    return this.bar = __bind(function(newProp) {
      return this.prop = newProp;
    }, this);
  });
}).call(this);</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Notice that CoffeeScript adds the __bind function which is then used to make sure the function executes in the object scope. Granted you can write this yourself
but the syntax of the CoffeeScript is a lot simpler and clearer as to what is going on.</p>

<p>After a few weeks of playing around I got Obscura into a state I was happy with for a first version release. It passed all the tests for inclusion on
<a href="http://microjs.com">microjs.com</a>, coming in at 1.5K compressed and gzipped, so I submitted it for inclusion and got it accepted. Obviously I was pretty pleased
about this as it was one of the main reasons for writing the library in the first place and it was great that my work was considered good enough to be accepted
onto the site but it didn&#8217;t stop there. Later in the same week I got an email from <a href="http://softpedia.com/">Softpedia</a> informing me that one of my projects had
been added to their Scripts section. At first I had no idea what they were talking about as I hadn&#8217;t submitted anything to Softpedia.Upon further investigation it
would appear that they&#8217;ve been scanning other websites and finding libraries and widgets to add to their new Scripts download section. The project they&#8217;d added
was Obscura so what I&#8217;m guessing has happened is they&#8217;ve been scanning through microjs.com and adding projects from there. It also appears they&#8217;ve been using
those projects as starting points to find other projects as throughout the day I got more emails telling me they&#8217;d added other projects that are on my blog and
github account. By the end of it 7 of my projects had been added; <a href="http://github.com/OiNutter/Obscura/">Obscura</a>, <a href="http://github.com/OiNutter/uncharted/">Uncharted</a>,

<a href="http://github.com/OiNutter/tipBox">tipBox</a> and <a href="http://github.com/OiNutter/delorean">Delorean</a>. For me this was a huge breakthrough in terms of what I&#8217;ve been
trying to achieve this year as it&#8217;s providing more avenues for people to find out about my work and hopefully use it and help improve it. It&#8217;s also resulted in
people starting to watch my GitHub repositories so hopefully I can build on this and keep raising my profile as the year goes on.</p>

<p>For now feel free to check out Obscura on GitHub for the code and demos</p>
