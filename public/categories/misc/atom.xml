    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There seems to be a strange belief amongst some developers that just because admin systems aren't shown to users, they don't have to spend any time on them. The result is control panels that are ugly to look at and a nightmare to use, because they've just been done in the simplest way possible. Honestly, I think this is complete and utter nonsense! If you're building something that people, whoever they are, have to interact with and you're not considering the user experience, you're doing it wrong!</p>

<p>Taking some time to think about how people will be using your admin system and planning accordingly will save everyone a lot of headaches down the line;</p>

<ul>
<li>You'll be less likely to have users bugging you about needing the admin to do something else, or to do something easier, which means more time to work on new things, rather than re-doing existing work.</li>
<li>Because the flow of the admin system is clearer and more intuitive, there's less chance of users making mistakes and doing the wrong thing with it, meaning you won't have to spend time fixing their mistakes.</li>
<li>Information will be presented to the end user much clearer, so you won't have to spend as much time explaining to them how it all works.</li>
</ul>


<p>For me there are other benefits to making the admin systems a lot nicer; in web development we spend a lot of our time having to make sure things are cross browser compatible, which can often mean not exploring the latest technologies or ideas, or making things as slick and funky as we'd like, because some browsers don't support the features we'd need. With admin systems we can often have a bit more say in what browsers people should be using, so we can restrict them to modern, up to date browsers, giving us the opportunity to try out some cool stuff that's going to make things much more interesting for both them and us.</p>

<p>Another thing often overlooked is the usefulness of colour. Colour coding information and buttons can give a much quicker visual clue than any label, allowing an end user to gain a broad overview of the information being displayed, just with a glance. This can also help with making the system more intuitive; green buttons for positive actions, red buttons for negative etc.</p>

<p>So next time you're building a backend for a site you're working on, or just any form of control panel. Stop and think about the end user. If possible ask them about how they would ideally want it to work, treat it like you would the design and developement of the front end and get user feedback throughout the process. Do all this (and act upon it) and you'll end up with much happier end users, even if the end user is you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to an issue raised on Uncharted by a fellow GitHub user pointing out that a lack of good examples was stopping people see if my work was any good and worth using I've started going through all my projects
and making sure they all have proper example pages and decent instructions in their README files.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[New Year's Resolutions]]></title>
    <link href="http://oinutter.co.uk/2011/01/08/new-years-resolutions/"/>
    <updated>2011-01-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://oinutter.co.uk/2011/01/08/new-years-resolutions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, so one of my goals for this year is to really start getting involved more in the coding community.  That is the whole intention of this blog, to try and share my learning experiences and provide a home for the various projects I'm working on in my own time in the hope that other people will find them useful.  There is also the hope that more knowledgeable and more skilled folk than myself might catch wind and offer advice and help to myself.</p>

<p>In actual fact this goal was something I set myself towards the end of last year, which is when I first started setting up this blog, but I never seemed to find time to actually kick it off.  I guess that's what New Year's resolutions are all about, making you take that step.  So here goes, the blog is now officially live, and you are now, hopefully, reading the inaugural post.</p>

<p>I'm going to try and post as often as possible on here, probably monthly at the moment until I find enough to write about more often.  I'll also be gradually adding pages and links for my various open source playground projects, so I'll undoubtedly be posting to launch them and keep you all updated on their progress.</p>

<p>Here's to 2011</p>

<p>Will</p>
